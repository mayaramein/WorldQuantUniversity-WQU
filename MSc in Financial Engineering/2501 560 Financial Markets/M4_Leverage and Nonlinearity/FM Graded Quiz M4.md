# FM Graded Quiz M3

## Question 1
**Question**: According to "Special Feature: Evaluating Changes in Correlations during Periods of High Market Volatility.", what is the primary reason for increased correlations between asset returns during periods of high market volatility?

- A. A natural consequence of probability theory even if the underlying relationships remain unchanged  
- B. Contagion effects between markets  
- C. New market structures or practices  
- D. Changes in the underlying relationships that determine returns  

**Answer**: **B. Contagion effects between markets**

**Explanation**: Increased correlations during high market volatility often arise due to contagion effects where market events in one area influence others, causing similar patterns across different assets.

## Question 2
**Question**: What is the main advantage of using the Sharpe ratio over the Coefficient of Variation?

- A. The Sharpe ratio is easier to calculate  
- B. The Sharpe ratio accounts for the risk-free rate  
- C. The Sharpe ratio is always positive  
- D. The Sharpe ratio works better for non-normal distributions  

**Answer**: **B. The Sharpe ratio accounts for the risk-free rate**

**Explanation**: The Sharpe ratio adjusts for the risk-free rate, providing a more accurate measure of risk-adjusted returns compared to the Coefficient of Variation.

## Question 3
**Question**: According to "Financial Management for Small Businesses", what does a beta coefficient of 0.48 for a potential new investment indicate?

- A. The new investment will eliminate 48% of the firm's portfolio risk  
- B. A 10% change in the firm's portfolio return will likely be accompanied by a 4.8% change in the new investment's return  
- C. The new investment will increase the firm's portfolio risk by 48%  
- D. 48% of the new investment's return is independent of the firm's portfolio return  

**Answer**: **B. A 10% change in the firm's portfolio return will likely be accompanied by a 4.8% change in the new investment's return**

**Explanation**: A beta coefficient of 0.48 implies the investment's returns are 48% as volatile as the market. This means its returns move 4.8% for every 10% market movement.

## Question 4
**Question**: Assume that a portfolio consists of two equally weighted assets having returns of 5% and 11%, standard deviations of 3% and 8% respectively, and the correlation between the two assets is 1. What is the reduction in volatility if the correlation was -0.5 instead?

- A. 0.02  
- B. 0.005  
- C. 0.01  
- D. -0.02  

**Answer**: **C. 0.01**

**Explanation**: The reduction in volatility occurs due to the lower correlation (-0.5), which reduces the covariance between the assets. Using the portfolio standard deviation formula confirms the value.

## Question 5
**Question**: If an asset allocation ETF charges 0.25% annually and you invest $50,000, what would be your annual fee?

- A. $125  
- B. $100  
- C. $175  
- D. $150  

**Answer**: **A. $125**

**Explanation**: Annual fee = $50,000 × 0.25% = $125. This is the cost incurred for managing the ETF.

## Question 6
**Question**: How might you create a hedging strategy using ETFs to protect against potential market downturns?

- A. Combine long positions in broad market ETFs with short positions in volatile sector ETFs or inverse ETFs  
- B. Increase leverage by borrowing to buy more of the same ETFs  
- C. Invest all assets in a single sector ETF  
- D. Sell all ETF holdings and hold only cash  

**Answer**: **A. Combine long positions in broad market ETFs with short positions in volatile sector ETFs or inverse ETFs**

**Explanation**: This strategy reduces exposure to market declines by offsetting long positions with short or inverse ETFs.

## Question 7
**Question**: Calculate the Sharpe ratio for a portfolio with return 8%, risk-free rate 1%, and standard deviation 5.162%.

- A. 1.215  
- B. 1.4  
- C. 1.3  
- D. 1.356  

**Answer**: **A. 1.215**

**Explanation**: Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation = (8% - 1%) / 5.162% ≈ 1.215.

---

## Question 8
**Question**: If an ETF tracking the S&P 500 has a correlation of 0.98 with the index, what is its tracking error?

- A. 0.02%  
- B. 0.98%  
- C. 1%  
- D. 2%  

**Answer**: **A. 0.02%**

**Explanation**: Tracking error reflects the standard deviation of differences in returns. A high correlation (0.98) leads to a minimal tracking error.

---

## Question 9
**Question**: How does volatility typically affect correlations between asset classes?

- A. Volatility has no effect on correlations  
- B. High volatility often leads to higher correlations  
- C. High volatility always leads to lower correlations  
- D. Low volatility always leads to higher correlations  

**Answer**: **B. High volatility often leads to higher correlations**

**Explanation**: During market turbulence, assets often move in tandem, leading to increased correlations.

## Question 10
**Question**: Propose a method to incorporate illiquid assets into a portfolio while maintaining accurate risk and return calculations. What challenges would you need to address?

- A. Develop a robust mark-to-model approach with regular valuation updates and stress testing  
- B. Exclude all illiquid assets from the portfolio  
- C. Assume illiquid assets have the same risk-return profile as liquid assets  
- D. Use only historical data for illiquid assets  

**Answer**: **A. Develop a robust mark-to-model approach with regular valuation updates and stress testing**

**Explanation**: Illiquid assets require mark-to-model valuations and stress tests to reflect their unique risks and infrequent price updates.

## Question 11
**Question**: Which of the following best describes the relationship between Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients?

- A. Pearson's is always larger than Spearman's  
- B. They are always equal  
- C. Spearman's is always larger than Pearson's  
- D. Spearman's is usually larger than Pearson's  

**Answer**: **D. Spearman's is usually larger than Pearson's**

**Explanation**: Spearman's rank correlation is less sensitive to outliers, often resulting in higher values than Pearson's linear correlation.

## Question 12
**Question**: If a portfolio consists of two assets with standard deviations of 6% and 2% respectively and a correlation of 0.5, what is the portfolio standard deviation for equal weights?

- A. 4.27%  
- B. 4.00%  
- C. 5.20%  
- D. 3.60%  

**Answer**: **B. 4.00%**

**Explanation**: Portfolio standard deviation formula yields ≈4.00% for these parameters.

## Question 13
**Question**: If two assets have a correlation of 0.5 and individual volatilities of 15% and 20%, what is their covariance?

- A. 0.025  
- B. 0.01  
- C. 0.02  
- D. 0.015  

**Answer**: **D. 0.015**

**Explanation**: Covariance = Correlation × Volatility(Asset 1) × Volatility(Asset 2) = 0.5 × 0.15 × 0.20 = 0.015.

## Question 14
**Question**: What is the primary focus of sector selection in ETF investing?

- A. Individual company performance analysis  
- B. Macro-economic modeling and understanding of business cycles  
- C. Predicting short-term individual stock rallies  
- D. Technical analysis of stock charts  

**Answer**: **B. Macro-economic modeling and understanding of business cycles**

**Explanation**: Sector selection typically depends on understanding broader economic trends.

## Question 15
**Question**: Calculate the weight of Stock A in a portfolio if it has 100 shares at $50 per share, and Stock B has 200 shares at $25 per share.

- A. 0.6  
- B. 0.5  
- C. 0.33  
- D. 0.4  

**Answer**: **B. 0.5**

**Explanation**: Stock A weight = Value of Stock A / Total Portfolio Value = (100 × $50) / [(100 × $50) + (200 × $25)] = 0.5.

## Question 16
**Question**: If a US-exchange-traded ETF's NAV is calculated at 11:30 AM ET due to tracking a European index and the US exchange closes at 4:00 PM ET, what time frame is considered the NAV of this ETF 'stale'?

- A. 9:30 AM ET - 11:30 AM ET  
- B. 12:00 PM ET - 4:00 PM ET  
- C. 9:30 AM ET - 4:00 PM ET  
- D. 11:30 AM ET - 4:00 PM ET  

**Answer**: **D. 11:30 AM ET - 4:00 PM ET**

**Explanation**: NAV becomes stale after calculation at 11:30 AM since it doesn't reflect updated US market data.
