## Questions and Answers with Explanations

### Question 1
**Which of the following is NOT typically used as an indicator of liquidity?**

- The bond's coupon rate
- Trading volume
- Bid-ask spread
- Time to execute a trade

**Answer:** The bond's coupon rate

**Explanation:** Liquidity indicators measure how easily an asset can be bought or sold in the market without affecting its price. Trading volume, bid-ask spread, and time to execute a trade are all direct indicators of liquidity. However, the bond's coupon rate is related to the bond's income stream and not its liquidity.

### Question 2
**How does a high Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio typically affect the probability of default?**

- It only affects the loss given default
- It decreases the probability of default
- It increases the probability of default
- It has no effect on the probability of default

**Answer:** It increases the probability of default

**Explanation:** A high LTV ratio means the borrower has less equity in the asset, increasing the risk of default, especially if the asset's value declines. This is because the borrower has less incentive to repay the loan when the asset value falls below the loan amount.

### Question 3
**According to "Do House Prices Influence Stock Prices?", what did the Pedroni panel cointegration test results indicate about the long-run relationship between house prices and stock prices?**

- There is no cointegration relationship between the variables
- There is a strong cointegration relationship between the variables
- There is a weak cointegration relationship between the variables
- The test was inconclusive about the cointegration relationship

**Answer:** There is a strong cointegration relationship between the variables

**Explanation:** The Pedroni panel cointegration test is used to assess long-term equilibrium relationships between variables. The study showed a strong cointegration relationship, indicating that house prices and stock prices move together over the long run.

### Question 4
**If a loan has an Exposure at Default (EAD) of $500,000 and a Loss Given Default (LGD) of 40%, what is the potential loss amount?**

- $150,000
- $300,000
- $200,000
- $250,000

**Answer:** $200,000

**Explanation:** Potential loss is calculated as:
\[ \text{Loss Amount} = \text{EAD} \times \text{LGD} \]
\[ \text{Loss Amount} = 500,000 \times 0.40 = 200,000 \]

### Question 5
**In a securitization structure with three tranches (Senior, Mezzanine, Equity) each with $100 million per value, if there are $150 million in losses, how much will the Mezzanine tranche lose?**

- $0 million
- $100 million
- $150 million
- $50 million

**Answer:** $50 million

**Explanation:** Losses are absorbed in reverse order of seniority, starting with the equity tranche. The first $100 million will wipe out the equity tranche, and the next $50 million will be absorbed by the mezzanine tranche.

---

### Question 6
**What potential impact could widespread mortgage refinancing have on MBS investors?**

- It could lead to reinvestment risk as principal is returned earlier than expected
- It would automatically trigger defaults on all MBS tranches
- It would have no effect on MBS cash flows
- It would always result in higher returns for all investors

**Answer:** It could lead to reinvestment risk as principal is returned earlier than expected

**Explanation:** Refinancing typically results in early repayment of principal, exposing investors to reinvestment risk as they might have to reinvest at lower rates.

---

### Question 7
**If you believe a bond has a probability of default of 15% and a recovery rate of 70%, what credit spread should you require?**

- 15%
- 4.50%
- 10.50%
- 21%

**Answer:** 4.50%

**Explanation:** Credit spread is calculated as:
\[ \text{Credit Spread} = \text{Probability of Default} \times (1 - \text{Recovery Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Credit Spread} = 0.15 \times (1 - 0.70) = 0.045 = 4.50\% \]

---

### Question 8
**What potential problem arises from the rear-view mirror approach of credit rating agencies?**

- Ratings may not reflect current market conditions accurately
- Ratings focus too much on future predictions
- Ratings change too frequently
- Ratings become too optimistic

**Answer:** Ratings may not reflect current market conditions accurately

**Explanation:** The rear-view mirror approach relies on historical data, which might not account for rapid changes in market conditions, leading to delayed updates in ratings.

---

### Question 9
**According to "Determination of Default Probability By Loss Given Default", which of the following best describes a limitation of the Market LGD approach?**

- It cannot be used for instruments without a liquid market
- It overestimates losses due to including a risk premium
- It requires a long time period to calculate accurate results
- It does not account for the time value of money

**Answer:** It cannot be used for instruments without a liquid market

**Explanation:** The Market LGD approach relies on observable market prices, which are unavailable for illiquid instruments.

---

### Question 10
**How might one critically assess the argument that increased regulation is necessary to prevent financial crises?**

- By disregarding the historical context of past financial crises
- By focusing solely on the costs of implementing new regulations
- By weighing the potential benefits against the risks of unintended consequences
- By assuming that all regulation is inherently detrimental

**Answer:** By weighing the potential benefits against the risks of unintended consequences

**Explanation:** A balanced assessment considers both the advantages and potential downsides of regulation, avoiding overly simplistic conclusions.

### Question 11
**If a bank has a loan with an EAD of $1,000,000, a PD of 3%, and an LGD of 45%, what is the expected loss?**

- $30,000
- $13,500
- $11,000
- $45,000

**Answer:** $13,500

**Explanation:** Expected loss is calculated as:
\[ \text{Expected Loss} = \text{EAD} \times \text{PD} \times \text{LGD} \]
\[ \text{Expected Loss} = 1,000,000 \times 0.03 \times 0.45 = 13,500 \]

---

### Question 12
**An MBS pool has $500 million in mortgages. If the average LTV ratio is 80%, what is the total value of the properties backing these mortgages?**

- $400 million
- $625 million
- $550 million
- $700 million

**Answer:** $625 million

**Explanation:** The total value of properties is calculated as:
\[ \text{Property Value} = \frac{\text{Loan Amount}}{\text{LTV Ratio}} \]
\[ \text{Property Value} = \frac{500}{0.80} = 625 \text{ million} \]

---

### Question 13
**What is the primary difference between subprime and prime conventional mortgages?**

- Subprime mortgages have lower interest rates
- Subprime mortgages are typically given to borrowers with lower credit ratings
- Prime mortgages are only available for commercial properties
- Prime mortgages cannot be securitized

**Answer:** Subprime mortgages are typically given to borrowers with lower credit ratings

**Explanation:** Subprime borrowers have higher credit risk, leading to higher interest rates compared to prime borrowers with strong credit profiles.

### Question 14
**According to "Introduction to Credit Risk Management", a 5-year CDS has a notional principal of €200 million and a spread of 120 basis points per year. If no default occurs, what is the total amount the buyer will pay over the life of the contract?**

- €12 million
- €2.4 million
- €10 million
- €14 million

**Answer:** €12 million

**Explanation:** Total payment is calculated as:
\[ \text{Payment} = \text{Notional Principal} \times \text{Spread} \times \text{Years} \]
\[ \text{Payment} = 200,000,000 \times 0.012 \times 5 = 12,000,000 \]

---

### Question 15
**How might the relationship between credit spread and probability of default change in extreme market conditions?**

- The relationship always remains perfectly linear
- The probability of default becomes fixed regardless of credit spread
- The credit spread becomes independent of probability of default
- The relationship may become non-linear

**Answer:** The relationship may become non-linear

**Explanation:** In extreme conditions, factors like liquidity constraints and market sentiment can distort the linear relationship between credit spreads and default probabilities.

---

### Question 16
**If you were designing a new credit risk model, which of the following factors would be LEAST important to include?**

- Debt-to-Income ratio
- Borrower's credit score
- Borrower's favorite watch value
- Loan-to-Value ratio

**Answer:** Borrower's favorite watch value

**Explanation:** This factor is irrelevant to financial risk assessment, unlike the other factors which directly indicate creditworthiness.
