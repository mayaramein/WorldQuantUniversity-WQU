# FM Practice Quiz M2 | Financial Concepts Quiz

## Question 1
**What is the main advantage of using logarithmic returns over arithmetic returns?**
- [ ] They are always positive  
- [x] They are additive over time  
- [ ] They provide higher returns  
- [ ] They are easier to calculate  

### **Answer: They are additive over time**

**Explanation:**
Logarithmic returns are preferred in financial analysis because they are time-additive, which allows for the cumulative return over multiple periods to be represented as the sum of individual returns. This property simplifies calculations and is critical for portfolio performance evaluation. Additionally, they align better with continuously compounded returns.

## Question 2
**Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a blockchain?**
- [ ] Transactions are irreversible once validated  
- [ ] All participants have a copy of the same ledger  
- [x] Transactions are encrypted  
- [ ] Transactions are centrally controlled and authorized  

### **Answer: Transactions are encrypted**

**Explanation:**
Blockchain does not inherently encrypt transactions; instead, it relies on cryptographic techniques to secure data and ensure integrity. The transparency of the blockchain allows all participants to view the transaction details, even though they are pseudonymous. Encryption is not a required feature.

## Question 3
**A company has 10 million shares outstanding and its current share price is $25. What is its market capitalization?**
- [ ] $100 million  
- [x] $250 million  
- [ ] $400 million  
- [ ] $2.5 billion  

### **Answer: $250 million**

**Explanation:**
Market capitalization is calculated as:
\[
\text{Market Cap} = \text{Share Price} \times \text{Shares Outstanding}
\]
Here, $25 \times 10,000,000 = 250,000,000 or $250 million.

## Question 4
**According to "Money And Debt: The Public Role of Banks", what percentage of the current broad monetary aggregate (M3) consists of cash?**
- [ ] 25%  
- [ ] 15%  
- [x] 3%  
- [ ] 7%  

### **Answer: 3%**

**Explanation:**
Cash constitutes only a small fraction of the broad monetary aggregate (M3), with the majority being held in deposits and other financial instruments. This highlights the minimal physical currency circulating compared to digital and credit-based money.

## Question 5
**Which distribution is characterized by a single parameter called 'degrees of freedom' and can exhibit excess kurtosis?**
- [ ] Normal distribution  
- [x] Student's t-distribution  
- [ ] F distribution  
- [ ] Log-normal distribution  

### **Answer: Student's t-distribution**

**Explanation:**
The Student's t-distribution is defined by its degrees of freedom and is known for its heavier tails (excess kurtosis) compared to the normal distribution. As the degrees of freedom increase, it converges to the normal distribution.

## Question 6
**Calculate the arithmetic return if a stock was bought for $100 and sold for $120.**
- [ ] 20%  
- [x] 25%  
- [ ] 15%  
- [ ] 0.2  

### **Answer: 25%**

**Explanation:**
Arithmetic return is calculated as:
\[
\text{Return} = \frac{\text{Final Price} - \text{Initial Price}}{\text{Initial Price}} \times 100
\]
Here, \((120 - 100) / 100 \times 100 = 25\%\).

---

## Question 7
**Calculate the excess kurtosis of a mixture of two normal distributions: 80% with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, and 20% with mean 0 and standard deviation 4.**
- [x] Approximately 7  
- [ ] Approximately 3  
- [ ] Approximately 10  
- [ ] Approximately 0  

### **Answer: Approximately 7**

**Explanation:**
The excess kurtosis of the mixture arises from the heavier tails introduced by the 20% component with a standard deviation of 4. This creates a variance in volatility, deviating from the normal distribution's kurtosis of 0.

---

## Question 8
**Assume the stock market is very efficient and no opportunity for stock value arbitrage trading. Calculate the expected dividend (D1) using the Gordon Growth Model if the current stock price is $60, the required return is 10%, and the growth rate is 5%.**
- [ ] $2.50  
- [x] $3.00  
- [ ] $3.50  
- [ ] $4.00  

### **Answer: $3.00**

**Explanation:**
The Gordon Growth Model formula is:
\[
P = \frac{D_1}{r - g}
\]
Rearranging for \(D_1\):  
\[
D_1 = P \times (r - g) = 60 \times (0.10 - 0.05) = 60 \times 0.05 = 3
\]

---

## Question 9
**Which of the following is true about logarithmic returns?**
- [ ] They cannot be used with negative price changes  
- [ ] They are only applicable for annual returns  
- [x] They are approximately equal to arithmetic returns for small changes  
- [ ] They are always larger than arithmetic returns  

### **Answer: They are approximately equal to arithmetic returns for small changes**

**Explanation:**
Logarithmic and arithmetic returns converge for small percentage price changes due to the properties of the natural logarithm. This makes them comparable in low-volatility scenarios.

---

## Question 10
**What is the primary difference between a centralized and decentralized blockchain network?**
- [ ] Centralized networks are faster and more efficient  
- [ ] Centralized networks use proof-of-stake consensus  
- [ ] Decentralized networks are always more secure  
- [x] Decentralized networks have no single point of control  

### **Answer: Decentralized networks have no single point of control**

**Explanation:**
A decentralized blockchain operates on a distributed ledger without a central authority, enhancing transparency and resilience. In contrast, centralized systems rely on a single entity for control, which creates a single point of failure.
