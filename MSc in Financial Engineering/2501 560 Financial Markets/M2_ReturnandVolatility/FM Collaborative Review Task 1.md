# FM Collaborative Review Task 1 | Investment Questions and Explanations

### **Question 1**
**Which of these is the safest? Safe should include the ability to never drop in price. State at least 2 reasons WHY you selected one or more securities OR why you did NOT select the other one/ones.**

**Answer:**
The safest option is **1. A 12-month certificate of deposit (CD)** that earns 2% annual interest. 

**Explanation:**
1. **Guaranteed Return:** CDs are insured by institutions like the FDIC, ensuring the principal and interest are paid regardless of market conditions.
2. **No Price Volatility:** Unlike bonds or stocks, the CD's value does not fluctuate. It guarantees a fixed return and no risk of capital loss.

Other options like bonds and stocks are subject to market risks, price fluctuations, and, in the case of risky bonds or stocks, higher volatility and credit risks.

### **Question 2**
**Which of these is likely to be the LEAST volatile? State at least 2 reasons WHY you selected one or more securities OR why you did NOT select the other one/ones.**

**Answer:**
The least volatile option is **2. A par 1-year risk-free bond with a 2% annual coupon.**

**Explanation:**
1. **Risk-Free Nature:** Government-issued risk-free bonds (like Treasury bonds) are backed by the government, ensuring repayment of principal and interest, making them highly stable.
2. **Fixed Coupon Payments:** The bond pays a fixed annual coupon, insulating it from market price volatility.

In contrast, risky bonds and stocks are subject to credit risk and market fluctuations. CDs are stable but not as liquid as bonds and require a lock-in period.

### **Question 3**
**Which of these has the highest expected return? State at least 2 reasons WHY you selected one or more securities OR why you did NOT select the other one/ones.**

**Answer:**
The highest expected return comes from **4. A $100 per share value stock that typically pays a 2–4% dividend annually.**

**Explanation:**
1. **Potential for Capital Gains:** Stocks can appreciate in value, offering higher returns than fixed-income securities.
2. **Dividends:** The 2–4% annual dividend provides an additional return, which is often reinvested for compounding growth.

Risk-free bonds and CDs provide lower fixed returns with no potential for capital appreciation, and risky bonds' higher coupon rates may not compensate for potential credit risks.

### **Question 4**
**Which of these can be sold short? State at least 2 reasons WHY you selected one or more securities OR why you did NOT select the other one/ones.**

**Answer:**
**4. Stocks** can be sold short.

**Explanation:**
1. **Liquidity and Market Accessibility:** Stocks are actively traded on exchanges, making it possible to borrow and sell shares to profit from price declines.
2. **Market Mechanisms:** Short-selling relies on market infrastructure that supports stock borrowing, which is not available for CDs or most bonds.

Short-selling is generally not feasible for fixed-income securities like CDs or bonds due to their nature and lack of short-selling markets.

### **Question 5**
**How are futures and forwards different? State at least 2 properties or conditions.**

**Answer:**
1. **Standardization and Trading:**
   - **Futures**: Traded on exchanges with standardized contract terms, ensuring liquidity and transparency.
   - **Forwards**: Traded over the counter (OTC) with customized terms tailored to the needs of the contracting parties.

2. **Settlement and Risk:**
   - **Futures**: Marked to market daily, reducing counterparty risk via a clearinghouse.
   - **Forwards**: Settled at maturity, exposing parties to higher counterparty risk due to the absence of a clearinghouse.

Futures offer more liquidity and lower risk due to exchange mechanisms, while forwards provide flexibility at the cost of higher risk.
