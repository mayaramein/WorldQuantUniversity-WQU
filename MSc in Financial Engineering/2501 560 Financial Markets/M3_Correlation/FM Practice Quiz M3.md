## Question 8
**If a portfolio consists of two assets with standard deviations of 3% and 8% respectively and a correlation of 1, what is the portfolio standard deviation for equal weights?**

\[
\sigma_p = \sqrt{(0.5^2 \times 0.03^2) + (0.5^2 \times 0.08^2) + (2 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.03 \times 0.08 \times 1)}
